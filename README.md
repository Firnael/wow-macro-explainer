# Wow Macro Explainer

This app will tell you what a World of Warcraft macro does when you write it in the editor box.

Directly inspired by the now retired [Fitzcairn's Macro Explain-o-matic](http://www.macroexplain.com/)

What it lacks in technical elegance, it tries to make up for in user-friendliness thanks to :
- syntax highlighting
- autocompletion

## Technical stuff

Built with :
- React (with Chakra UI)
- CodeMirror (and its lezer grammar system)
